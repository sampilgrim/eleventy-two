A cycle tour that started out as Munich to Vienna. Then I bailed because it was freezing cold and wet, and took a train to France instead for warmer climes. Tried to cycle from Strasbourg to Calais. Ate lots of pastries, found some excellent canal paths. Hurt my knee cycling through the Champagne region and limped home. [See Strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/2374155647)
